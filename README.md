### Htaccess file :

Htaccess is a configuration file for the Apache web server, and the mod_rewrite directive tells to Apache that every request will end up to the index.php located in the folder named public.
Another thing: using htaccess and drive the traffic under the public folder, the rest of your projectâ€™s structure will be hidden to anyone.
